## Python setup

For now, the repo files doesn't use a lot of external modules. So, any basic `Python 2.7` with `matplotlib`, `jupyter` and `numpy` should work. An [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python) environment is advisable. After installing the conda manager run the following lines on a terminal to set your environment (Linux/Mac OS). 

```bash
conda create --name probnum python=2
source activate probnum
conda install jupyter 
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

### For windows users

Open the command line bundled with your Anaconda installation and run the following

```bash
conda create --name probnum python=2
activate probnum
conda install jupyter 
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

That should get you started. After your environment is set, load a jupyter session within the directory of your cloned repo. 

Any further customisations will be posted as needed. Any changes to the repository will be handled by forked clones of the original.
